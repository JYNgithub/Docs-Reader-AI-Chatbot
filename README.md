# DocsReader

Not the 1000th PDF or document chatbot.  
**DocsReader** is a chatbot designed to be your learning partner for selected Python libraries, using **official documentation** as its source.  

- Can it build your whole project with one prompt? **No**  
- Can it help you learn new tools with accurate syntax and information? **Yes**  


## Limitations

As this is a hobby project, it has some limitations:
- Limited number of libraries supported
- Limited scalability


## TODO

- [x] Implement a script for database management
- [ ] Dockerize and deploy (later priority)  

## Note
Interrupting `scraper.py` may cause a bug where expected and actual collections differ
