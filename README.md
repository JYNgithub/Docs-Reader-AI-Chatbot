This project is still under development.

No, this is not the 1000th PDF and document chatbot.  
This is a chatbot specifically for documentations of selected Python libraries.  
Can it build your whole project with one prompt? No  
Can it give you accurate syntax and information based on official documentation? Yes  

Note: As this remains a hobby project, it will inevitably be limited in terms of scalability and total libraries it can scrape.

TODO: Expand libraries

TODO: Add pruning after every scrape?

TODO: Make a function that can scrape through sitemaps

TODO: Dockerize (later priority) / Deploy?
